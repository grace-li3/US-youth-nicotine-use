# Analyzing Youth Political Beliefs, Academic Performance, and Substance Use 

This project applies data science techniques such as data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), categorical mapping, data visualization using bar and pie charts, and cross-tabulation to analyze relationships between political beliefs, academic performance, and substance use trends among high school seniors.

### Introduction
The Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan conducted a study “Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of American Youth” that explores changes in the values, behaviors, and lifestyle orientations of contemporary American high school seniors, focusing on a wide array of topics including drug use, attitudes towards various social issues, and demographic characteristics. This data is valuable for understanding social trends, health-related behaviors, and policy impacts on American youth. A total of 9,599 students/observations from 6 different forms participated in this web-based survey in 2022. According to the website there were about 1400 variables across six different questionnaires in this prospective observational study, including sex, race, political beliefs, and types of household members. Prospective studies are designed to follow subjects forward in time, and in this case, the researchers are observing a cohort of high school seniors to see how their values, behaviors, and lifestyles evolve. Though according to python calculations, I iterated through a list of dataframes, collecting all unique column names across these data frames into a list, and then returned the total count of these unique columns – 1673 unique variables. This could be due to some variables being recorded in two different formats or weights were not considered. This sampling process is considered a multistage cluster sampling, initially selecting geographic areas or primary sampling units (PSUs), then schools within those PSUs, and finally students within chosen schools. Sampling strategy varied by school size, with all seniors participating in smaller schools and samples drawn in larger schools. Schools were sampled over two years, with non-participating schools replaced by similar ones, and the student sample was divided into subsamples for different questionnaire forms. With a participation rate between 66-85% among schools and an overall student response rate of 75%, the study's methodology suggests a largely unbiased sample, designed to accurately reflect the population of interest while minimizing potential biases, making it as representative and unbiased as possible within the practical constraints of survey research.

### Characteristics of Sample

*Political Party Belief*
I analyzed the political party beliefs distribution of the dataset. The survey question asks: “How would you describe your political beliefs?” and the following answers are provided: 1="Very Conservative", 2="Conservative", 3="Moderate", 4="Liberal", 5="Very Liberal", 6="Radical", 8="None of the above, or don't know." I chose a pie chart to depict the data because the provided answers were categorical and I wanted to show the relative proportions of a whole. The pie chart illustrated that more than half of the students identify as moderate and apolitical. A significant portion of the respondents identify as moderate, suggesting a centrist political inclination, while the largest segment represents those who either do not affiliate with a particular belief or are unsure. This could indicate political disengagement or dissatisfaction with current political categorizations. Overall, the diversity in political beliefs shows a heterogeneous political landscape.

*Average Letter Grade*

I created a bar graph to show the distribution of average letter grades. The average letters grades are discrete and have a quantitative count (grade value out of 100) associated with each letter. The survey question asked: “Which one of the following best describes your average grades in this school year?” The answers ranged from 9 = A (93-100), 8= A- (90-92), 7= B+ (87-89), 6= B (83-86), 5 = B- (80-82), 4 = C+ (77-79), 3= C (73-76), 2= C- (70-72), 1= D (0-69). The graph reveals a trend of a skew towards higher academic performances, with most students falling within the ‘A’ to ‘B’ range and fewer students receiving grades of ‘C’ or below.

*Nicotine Addiction Belief*

This survey question asks: “In your opinion how addictive is vaping nicotine regularly?” The provided answers are 8="I don't know”, 1="Not at all addictive", 2="A little addictive", 3="Somewhat addictive", 4="Very addictive." Given this categorical data, a table is fitting to quickly understand the range of perceptions on nicotine addiction. The table shows that the majority of students (1324 students) perceive nicotine vaping as 'Very addictive', with this category having the highest count. The second highest category is “I don’t know” with 785 students which indicates general uncertainty that could warrant further educational initiatives to inform students about the health implications of vaping nicotine.

### Relationships Between Variables
*How does students’ academic performance influence belief on nicotine/vaping addiction?*
<img width="428" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 12 36 20 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c1ad439-ee55-4362-bc6c-0d1ef434bab8" />

I used a stacked bar chart to provide a visual segmentation of opinion about nicotine addiction within each academic grade group. The graph suggests that students with higher grades (A to B range) are more likely to believe that nicotine is 'Very addictive', while this belief appears less prevalent among students with lower grades (C and below). It’s interesting to note that there is a large number of “I don’t know” responses across all grade levels. The chart suggests that students with high academic grades may be more informed about the risks of nicotine/vaping addiction. However, without analysis on other variables such as personal values or types of education exposures, we cannot conclusively determine whether there is a direct causation in this relationship.

*Do students’ political party beliefs correlate to marijuana usage?*
<img width="515" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 12 37 01 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca29397b-2683-4577-ab83-d9a3aa01b034" />

The table presents the relationship between students' political beliefs and their marijuana usage. I categorized the responses to the marijuana use survey question (On how many occasions (if any) have you used marijuana (weed, pot) or hashish (hash, hash oil). . . (Do
NOT count any use of CBD products) . . . during the last 30 days?) into a new variable: 'Type of Smoker.' Students were grouped from 'Not a Smoker' to 'Excessive Smoker' based on the frequency of marijuana use reported. In the last 30 days, if they smoked 40 or more occasions, they were classified as an “excessive smoker,” if they smoked 20-39 or 10-19 or 6-9 occasions they were classified as a “Frequent Smoker,” if they smoked 3-5 occasions they were classified as a “Occasional Smoker,” if they smoked 1-2 occasions they were classified as a “Rare Smoker,” and if they smoked 0 occasions they are classified as not a smoker. This categorization clarifies that as marijuana use increases, the category of smoker intensifies. The data table reveals that across political spectrums, the majority are 'Not a Smoker', with 'Excessive Smokers' being a minority, and a large number of politically indifferent students also tend to be non-smokers. Those identifying as 'None of the above, or don't know' have the highest numbers of 'Excessive' and 'Frequent Smokers,' indicating less defined political beliefs correlate with higher smoking frequency. This data could suggest various socio-political factors influencing students' smoking behaviors, although more context would be needed for in-depth analysis.

### Context
The relationships implied by the data suggest correlations rather than causation between students' academic performance and their beliefs on nicotine/vaping addiction, as well as between their political beliefs and marijuana usage. Higher academic grades correlate with a stronger belief in the addictiveness of nicotine, possibly indicating that better-informed students or those with better health education understand the risks of nicotine/vaping addiction. However, this relationship could be confounded by other factors such as cultural background, where some cultures have strong stigmatization towards nicotine use. Some cultures highly value academic success, and will lower their intake of nicotine addiction to perform better academically. A colliding variable would be alcohol usage, where students who engage in one risky behavior might be more or less likely to engage in more risky behaviors and can affect their beliefs on the addictiveness of nicotine.
 
Regarding marijuana use and political beliefs, the data show a higher frequency of marijuana usage among students with less defined political beliefs. A potential confounding variable could be parental influence. Students who have parents who are against marijuana may have more conservative political beliefs, while parents who support marijuana may have a more laid back view on life and politics. The parental influence could shape the students’ political beliefs and attitudes to drug use. A potential collider in this relationship might be social circle characteristics, where students could be influenced by both their political beliefs (students might gravitate towards peers with similar political views) and their marijuana usage (students might also seek peers with similar attitudes towards drug use). The traits of a student’s social circle might strengthen or weaken the correlation between their political views and how they use marijuana.
To further understand these relationships, I would explore the question: To what extent does health education directly impact students' beliefs about addiction? This would require data on students' beliefs about addiction before and after receiving health education (this could include their understanding of addiction's causes and risks) and detailed metrics about the education quality (instructor qualifications, school ranking, student engagement metrics).

### Conclusion
I learned valuable insights on the American high school senior’s different behaviors and perceptions wards illicit substances, specifically their grades and political beliefs towards marijuana use and drug use. Throughout this process I learned how to analyze and visualize the relationship between variables through different graphical representations, in particular how to make a stacked bar chart and create a new variable based on existing variables. It was interesting to see that there are discernible patterns between variables, however it is important to understand that observed patterns do not necessarily imply direct causation. I learned the importance of adopting a nuanced and cautious approach when interpreting such patterns, and have come to realize human behavior is real complex, especially when it comes to youth engagement with illicit substances.
